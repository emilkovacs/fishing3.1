//@Work
/// Schedule Fishing meet for early next week.
/// Look up instagram options. --> Let's start Manually. @Dorka, ok? 3-4 accounts a day ...
/// Dev the screens.
///

//@App
/// Lift the details to a new view to create a cleaner screen,
/// lift weather and solunar to a new view.
/// Where can i delete a catch? :D --> List action + Context menu, buut on the edit screen?
/// Maybe merge catch&Water to a details and stay inline with alternate looking dropdown headings? There are lots of line in the design ..
/// It's more work but it's more logical to have the weathear and solunar things in a new view since they are read only and not editable. A type focused minimal view will do it i can always refreactor it later since it;s not connected deeply to logic flow.



/// Leave iCloud sync for now.
///
///
/// Full screen photo manager will be great
/// Charts and List/Map will be beautiful, even with a fucking year picker.
/// Ideate on a share screen? That's it.
